<native_pdb_id>.pdb is the initial Native PDB we received from Frank.
<native_pdb_id>_0001.pdb is the initial Native PDB put through an empty XML to obtain the atom types in the last column of the PDB.
<native_pdb_id>_0001.clean.pdb is the scored/labeled Native PDB with only ATOM lines.

1a2y and 1b0b were removed - they do not have any decoys and there are heteroatoms in the natives.
2a28 was also removed as it does not have any decoys either.
1iib in set1 was fetched from the pdb
